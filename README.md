# EAST_ADL_METRICS

A tool which was developed in my bachelor thesis. <br>
It takes an EAST-ADL project (EAXML-file) and measures the quality of the given model according to metrics and rules which got transferred from another tool called SDMetrics.
On top of that it also has self-developed metrics and rules.

Original metrics from SDMetrics: https://www.sdmetrics.com/PF_SysML.html
